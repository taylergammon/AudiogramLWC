# AudiogramLWC - Experimenting with ChatGPT and LWCs

An Lightning Web Component that displays audiometric data on a chart typically used in hearing aid fittings. 

Goal:  Create an Audiogram Chart.

Description: Create an LWC that takes the data from a RecordId and parses it into the chart being displayed on the record.  An audiogram is a graph that shows audiometric data and is used by hearing professionals.  

End result: A working chart and proof of concept.  Even though I know I am a novice developer and that there are probably improvements to be made, it was cool to only use AI and create something for free that works. 

My Final Thoughts

I would like to continue to make improvements to this chart.  I have enjoyed continually making improvements and digging into ChartJS.  If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know.

Disclaimers:
I know that some of the code may be wrong or there may be a better way.  I donâ€™t claim this as my own.  I used ChatGPT to help me get this far.  I do value what I am learning.
