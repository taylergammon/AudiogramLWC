# AudiogramLWC
An LWC that displays audiometric data on a chart typically used in hearing aid fittings. 
Experimenting with ChatGPT and LWCs

Goal:  Create an Audiogram Chart.

Description: Create an LWC that takes the data from a RecordId and parses it into the chart being displayed on the record.  An audiogram is a graph that shows audiometric data and is used by hearing professionals.  

End result: A working chart and proof of concept.  Even though I know I am not a developer and that there are probably improvements to be made, it was cool to only use AI and create something for free that works. 

My Final Thoughts

I would like to continue to make improvements to this chart.  Just a few things that I can’t figure out right now is how to reverse the chart where -10 is at the top and it goes to 120. I’d like to have the chart static with -10 at the top, the 0 dB line bold, and 120 at the bottom.  Update: Was running an older version of Chart.js.  Final code is below and is working!

Disclaimers:
I know I am not a developer.  I know that some of the code may be wrong or there may be a better way.  I don’t claim this as my own.  I used ChatGPT to help me get this far.  I do value what I am learning.
